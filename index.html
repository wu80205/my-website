            <p>Hello World! I'm Jason, and what you're seeing here is (obviously) my website.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As you can probably tell, the reason why I have a website like this is because (you guessed it, ) I am a developer, and this was all written using HTML.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Despite not being too experienced, I can at least program in some other languages like Python, Java and C.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I started my passion for programming when I was only 7, and in fact, my programming teacher said that they were amazed by the programs I wrote at the time. That was what led me to writing this webpage to share my story with you.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Any questions or comments? Feel free to send me an email. </p>
